#Orcs of the Darklands

Though they are often savage and uneducated it is a mistake to assume that orcs are stupid.  They all have a base cunning and good survival instincts, but the clan leaders will be much more subtle.  The larger the clan (or group of clans), the more clever the leader must be in order to manage internal and external politics, military strategy, and clan logistics.

There are many orc clans inhabiting the Silvermist Mountains.  They exist in a volatile mix of shifting clan alliances and external threats like dragons, rival goblin tribes, and encroaching Kerans. 

Orcs are well-equiped depsite their nomadic and unstable lives.  Some of their equipment is captured during raids, but much of it has an unknown origin; the style, materials, and workmanship of orc weapons and armor are unique.  There is much speculation about where these wepons come from, but no one has any evidence of their true origins
