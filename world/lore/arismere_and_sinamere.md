##Before the Empire (500 years ago and earlier)

Uthash has been settled from the earliest times.  It's origins are lost in the fog of the past.  Situated at the junction of two mighty rivers (the Shin and the Ar), it is a center of commerce and learning. 

##The Keran Empire (500 years ago)

The city-state of Ker was an unstoppable military and economic juggernaut.  It became an empire ruled by a supposedly immortal Empress known as The Radiant. The key to its power are the Imperial Archons: wizards who can open permanent gateways between places, as well as using temporary gates for exploration and moving goods and armies instantly.

The Empire established several gateways in Uthash (which was annexed through economic pressure rather than military conquest).  The gateways linked to other trade centers, bypassing bandits and stormy seas.

The old trade roads quickly fell into disuse and kingdoms shrank. Orc tribes and other things moved into the empty spaces.  The citizens of the Keran Empire call theses places ‘darklands’.

##The Plague War (200 years ago)

One day, the gates stopped working.  No one knew if it was just the Uthash gates or if all of the gates everywhere had failed.  

Rioters and frightened citizens filled the streets.  The Imperial garrison tried to restore peace, but they were overwhelmed.  The Imperial governor and magistrates were killed during the chaos.

A coalition of noble houses (who had ruled Uthash before the Empire) stepped into the power vacuum and began to rebuild.  An old rivalry between the Aris and Sina clans fractured the new government.  A secret war of assassination and sabotage began, and quickly escalated to open fighting.

One of the clans unleashed a magical disease that spread like wildfire.  In days, half the city's population was dead.  None of the survivors knew who had started the plague, but both sides decided that they’d had enough.  The center of the city had to be abandoned due to the infection, so each house retreated to their ancestral holdings and founded new cities, named Arismere and Sinamere.

##Arismere and Sinamere (now)

Arismere and Sinamere share an uneasy peace.  Intermarriage between the founding families of each city have reduced tensions in some ways, but both sides are wary.  Uthash, the old city, remains abandoned.  There are many stories of the brave or foolish wandering into its bone-littered streets, never to be seen again.

A more lucrative (and survivable) option is exploration of the darklands.  Uthashie expeditions have reestablished ties with a few of their Imperial trading partners and found value in various mines and ancient ruins.
