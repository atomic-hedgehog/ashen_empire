#The road to Phalandin

This rutted wagon track heads east from Arismere to the village of Phandalin. It winds through low hills covered with dense forest.  Recently, goblins have begun to ambush supply convoys moving between Arismere and Phandalin.  A wagon convoy takes about five days to reach Phandalin.  The trail leading south to the goblin cave is two days into the journey from Arismere.
