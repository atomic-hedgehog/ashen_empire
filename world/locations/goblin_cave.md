#Goblin Cave

A network of natural caves, some of which have been expanded artifically.  An underground river flows from inside the cave.  THere are several levels to the cave.  

##The Gate Room
The bottom level contains a room that is littered with the charred bodies of goblins and wolves.  Columns of green stone carved with the likenesses of dragons surround the obsidian spikes of a Keran Gate.  On the ground around the gate are dry corpses dressed in rusted armor with the Keran sunburst emblem.
